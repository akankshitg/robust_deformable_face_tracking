To use the code you can call the whole pipeline from one of the bash scripts.
Probably you need to adapt the paths in `utils/path_and_folder_definition.py` to fit your system.

Most of the python files expect to be provided a base path. Inside that base path a `frames/` folder 
is expected with the frames of the respective clip.
The scripts will iteratively run for all clips in the `frames/` folder.


Explanation of the files:

* dlib_predictor.py: Uses pre-trained (generic) detector to detect the bounding box of the face and then applies a shape predictor (from dlib).
* ffld2.py: Trains a person specific detector, based on the input bounding boxes and then detects using that model. Additionally, it applies the same shape predictor as dlib_predictor.
* ps_pbaam: Trains a generic + ps part-based AAM and then fits it on the person.
* svm_is_face: Checks whether the landmarks correspond to an actual human face. If the trained SVM does not exist, it trains it.
