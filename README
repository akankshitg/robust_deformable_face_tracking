To use the code you can call the whole pipeline from one of the bash scripts. 
Probably you need to adapt the paths in utils/path_and_folder_definition.py to fit your system. 

Most of the python files expect to be provided a base path. Inside that base path a frames/ folder is expected with the frames of the respective clip. 
The scripts will iteratively run for all clips in the frames/ folder.
